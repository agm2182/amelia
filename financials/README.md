## Data Sources

### Shopify (via Admin GraphQL API)
- Full order export with financial/fulfillment status
- **Coverage:** Jan 1 - Dec 31, 2025

### Meta Ads (via Meta Ads API)
- Monthly performance metrics: spend, impressions, clicks, reach
- **Coverage:** Jan - Oct 2025 (ads paused Nov-Dec)

### TikTok Shop (manual export)
- Quarterly exports from TikTok Shop Seller Center
- Includes fees, orders, payments, settlements
- **Coverage:** Jan 1 - Dec 31, 2025

### TikTok Ads
- Combined from Chase card transactions and TikTok Ads API
- API has engagement metrics for Apr, Oct, Nov only
- **Coverage:** Jan - Dec 2025

### Chase Credit Card
- Categorized transaction-level data
- Categories: advertising, inventory, software, fees
- **Coverage:** Jan - Dec 2025

## Expense Categories

| Category | Vendor/Description |
|----------|-------------------|
| `advertising/tiktok` | TikTok Ads charges |
| `advertising/meta` | Facebook/Instagram ads |
| `inventory` | Resource Fashion (manufacturer) |
| `software` | Mailchimp (email marketing) |
| `fees/interest` | Credit card interest charges |
| `fees/late` | Late payment fees |

## Known Data Limitations

1. **TikTok Shop monthly values** are quarterly totals ÷ 3 (approximation)
2. **TikTok Ads API gaps** - Chase captures spend, API has metrics for limited months
3. **Meta Ads Nov-Dec** shows $0 - ads were paused, not missing data
4. **Shopify order breakdowns missing** - subtotal/shipping/tax/discounts columns are 0; only total populated
5. **Refund amounts not captured** - `refunded` column shows $0 even for REFUNDED orders

## Resolved Data Questions

### 301 Shopify orders with $0 total (RESOLVED)
These are two types of orders:
- **TikTok Shop synced orders** - Tagged `["free", "tiktok"]` with `@scs.tiktokw.us` email. Payment via TikTok, synced to Shopify for fulfillment only.
- **Free exchanges/replacements** - Tagged `["exchange", "free"]` or `["damage", "exchange", "free"]`. Customer service replacements at no charge.

### Meta Ads billing source (RESOLVED)
The $77.4K Meta spend (per API) is billed across two payment methods:
- **Shopify Credit**: $22,646.59 in 2025 (see `loans/shopify/credit_purchases.csv`)
- **Unknown**: ~$54.7K remaining - likely direct credit card not in our data

### May 2025 revenue drop (RESOLVED)
Shopify had a **23-day gap** (May 8 - June 1) with zero orders:
- All 45 May orders occurred May 1-8
- TikTok Shop continued normally during this period
- Meta Ads kept spending $10.8K with no Shopify conversions
- This was a Shopify-specific issue (checkout/maintenance/payment/inventory)

### Shopify Credit purchases (RESOLVED)
Scraped 168 purchase transactions from Shopify Admin → Finance → Credit → Purchases tab.
**2025 totals**: TikTok Ads $2,431.87 + Meta Ads $22,646.59 = $25,078.46
See `loans/shopify/credit_purchases.csv`

## Data Gaps to Fill

| Missing Data | Where to Get It | Impact |
|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| COGS/inventory costs | Resource Fashion invoices, other suppliers | Needed for true profit calculation |
| Shipping/fulfillment costs | 3PL invoices, USPS/UPS statements | Major expense currently untracked |

See `DATA_DICTIONARY.md` for complete schema documentation.
